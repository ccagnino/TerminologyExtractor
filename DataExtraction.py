'''Data Extraction Module

This module contains three functions needed for extracting data for terminology entry, such as 
terminology candidates, sentences in which they appear and possible definitions. It requires 
importing functions from text pre-processing module.

Functions
---------
get_chunks(chunked)
    Takes in a list of parse trees, returns a list of term candidates
extract_context(term_cand, sent_list)
    Takes in a terminology candidate and sentence list, returns context sentences
extract_def(term_cand, context)
    Takes in a terminology candidate and context sentences, returns definitions for terminology candidate

    the second one filters out terms shorter than two characters and those already present in all_terms list.

    Parameters
    ----------
    chunked : list
        List of parse tree for terminology candidate extraction

    Returns
    -------
